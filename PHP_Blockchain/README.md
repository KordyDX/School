This PHP code implements a basic blockchain data structure with the ability to add blocks, retrieve blocks by ID, check the validity of the blockchain, and generate a hash for each block. The code consists of three files:

Chain.php: This file contains the Chain class which is the main class that represents the blockchain and implements the IChain interface. It has methods to get the last block of the chain, add a new block to the chain, retrieve a block by its ID, and check the validity of the chain.

Block.php: This file contains the Block class which represents a block in the blockchain. Each block has an ID, a value, and a hash. The Block class also has a method to generate a hash for a block given its ID, value, and the hash of the previous block in the chain.

IChain.php: This file contains an interface that defines the methods that the Chain class must implement.

This code is intended as a starting point for building a more complex blockchain implementation and is not suitable for use in production environments.
